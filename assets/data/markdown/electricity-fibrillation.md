Chaotic electrical waves (red ECG trace) cause uncoordinated contraction of the heart muscle. This reduces the heart's ability to generate pressure (red trace).

This is a serious medical condition that needs to be treated immediately. An automated external defibrillator (AED) is able to restore the smooth electrical waves in the heart by applying a large electrical shock across the chest.
