If a minor heart attack is left untreated, or if medication is stopped too early, then the coronary artery blockage can become more severe.

A severe heart attack can cause permanent damage to a large portion of heart tissue. This prevents the heart from generating enough pressure to pump blood around the body (red trace).

Muscle damage due to a heart attack can lead to problems with electrical activity of the heart. Untreated heart attacks can eventually lead to heart failure.
