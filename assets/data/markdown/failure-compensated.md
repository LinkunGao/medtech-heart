In compensated heart failure the muscular walls of the heart get thicker in response to prolonged high blood pressure. Open the heart (double-click) to see the thicker heart walls.

In compensated failure, during each beat less blood is able to enter the heart, because of thicker walls, increased stiffness, and/or delayed relaxation.

At rest, the heart can cope with these problems, and patients may not show any symptoms. However, during exercise or stress, they may find that their hearts cannot effectively respond to the increased demand to pump blood.

Researchers are still seeking effective treatment options for patients with compensated heart failure. Some suggest that it may lead on to decompensated heart failure, described in the tab below.
